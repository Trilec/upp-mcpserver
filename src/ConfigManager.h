#include "McpServer.h" // It seems McpServer.h is in ../include not here

// Correcting the include path for McpServer.h
// #include "McpServer.h" should be #include "../include/McpServer.h" if McpServer.h is in include/
// However, typical U++ project structure might handle this with include paths.
// For now, assuming the build system will find McpServer.h from the include directory.
// If not, this path will need adjustment: e.g. #include "include/McpServer.h" or similar
// For a file in src/ to include a file in include/, it's often "../include/McpServer.h"
// But U++ uses .upp files to define packages and their include paths.
// The design doc implies McpServer.h is a public header, so it should be findable.
// Let's assume the U++ build system handles this.

// The design brief specifies #include "McpServer.h"
// This implies that the 'include' directory is in the include path for the compiler.
// So, we will stick to the design brief.
